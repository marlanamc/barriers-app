# Legacy/Unused Candidates (needs confirmation)

Do not delete yet. Confirm in code/UX before archiving.

- Routes to review: `app/command-center`, `app/starlight`, `app/map`, `app/toolkit`, `app/offline`, `app/coaching-hq`, `app/about`.
- Possibly redundant lists/flows: `app/for-later`, `app/tomorrow`, `app/all-tasks`, `app/brain-dump` (check if still linked anywhere outside SidePanel).
- Legacy components: `components/command-center/*`, older onboarding flows under `components/onboarding/*`, any unused weather/focus pickers if found.
- Content/docs: `coachingframework.md`, `MULTIPLE_ANCHORS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` (keep for reference), older map/toolkit assets in `public/icons`.

Action: as we QA routes, mark what’s truly unused here and move confirmed legacy items to archive.
