# Captain's Map - Complete Level Deep Dives

This document contains comprehensive breakdowns of all 15 levels in the Captain's Map framework for ADHD support.

---

## Level 1: Life Vest
**Core Concept:** Self-compassion

<aside>
<img src="/icons/star_lightgray.svg" alt="/icons/star_lightgray.svg" width="40px" />

### Quick Overview

- **What?** A simple mantra or reminder that softens the inner critic
- **How?** By offering yourself compassion before pushing forward
- **When?** Anytime you feel overwhelmed, ashamed, or stuck, especially *before* starting a task
- **Why?** Because shame spirals stop progress, compassion gets you moving
- **Where?** Keep it visible: mirror, phone screen, planner
</aside>

### What Is the Life Vest?

> "Can I offer myself grace before I try to 'fix' anything?"

Your Life Vest is your internal safety net. When you're overwhelmed, ashamed, or stuck, this is your first move. It's how you soften the story in your head so you can move forward without spiraling.

---

### Why it Matters

- ADHD brains are wired for perfectionism, RSD, and shame spirals.
- Shame doesn't motivate — it paralyzes.
- Skipping self-compassion = burnout, avoidance, shutdown.
- When you lead with care, you unlock actual momentum.

---

### Why ADHD Brains Need This

ADHD brains often carry years of messaging like "You're lazy" or "You just need to try harder." This creates a **shame loop** — where every struggle feels like a character flaw instead of a pattern.

Here's what's really going on:

- ADHD brains are **sensitive to rejection and failure**, so we avoid starting to avoid messing up
- We often have **emotional intensity** that makes little things feel huge
- We feel **guilt** about being "behind" and assume kindness = giving up

But self-compassion isn't permission to quit. It's the reset button that actually lets you start.

When you feel stuck or ashamed, your brain doesn't need pressure. It needs **safety**. That's what the Life Vest gives you — a mental and emotional grounding before anything else.

---

### When to Use this Level

- At the start of every session or solo check-in
- Before big transitions (starting work, leaving the house, switching tasks)
- After a shame spiral (scrolling, missing a deadline, snapping at someone)
- During stuck moments (when you can't start, can't focus, or feel gross)

---

### Core Practice: Create Your Mantra

Choose one that feels honest, not cheesy. This is a voice you can believe when you're underwater.

Examples I offer to you:

- "My mess isn't a moral failure."
- "Being human is allowed here."
- "I'm allowed to start from this moment."
- "Remembering you are enough in this moment, just as you are, simply by being."
- "Perfect isn't real."
- "Showing up imperfectly serves myself and others."
- "I don't have to earn rest."
- "Growth isn't linear."
- "Messy progress is still progress."
- "Begin Again"
- "Let go."
- "Even though it all feels a bit overwhelming at the moment, I choose to accept and embrace the challenge, and work out what I need to do about it."

---

### Make it Visible

Where can you place your mantra so it actually helps?

- Sticky note on your mirror
- Phone lock screen
- Whiteboard near your desk
- Inside your logbook

Seeing it is what makes it interrupt the spiral.

---

### How it Connects to Other Levels

- You can't reach your **Destination** if your nervous system is underwater.
- You can't use your **Compass** when you're lost in shame fog.
- It sets the tone for using **Ration**, **Anchor**, and **Buoy**.
- It makes your **Logbook** gentle and honest, not judgmental.

---

### Principles and Self-Talk to Adapt into Mantras:

- **Embrace a "shame-free" policy:** Instead of saying "Oh, what a shame!" or "You should be ashamed of yourself!", practice phrases that eliminate shame and judgment. A mantra could be **"This is a shame-free zone for me."**
- **Shift from "should" and "have to" language to empowering choice:** Avoid phrases like "I should have..." or "I could have..." as they breed toxic emotions of shame, guilt, and regret. Replace them with empowering statements like **"I will..."**, **"I may..."**, or **"I choose to..."**. Similarly, replace "have to," "ought to," "need to," and "I must" with **"When I..."**, **"If I..."**, or **"I've decided to..."**. These proactive statements emphasize agency and intention.
- **Focus on process and internal experience, not just outcomes:** Rather than aiming solely for an external result, celebrate the process and your efforts. The goal is to **"feel successful"** rather than just be successful. This means acknowledging positive actions and reinforcing them, even if they are tiny.
- **"Don't feed the Demon"**: This concept relates to the Default Mode Network (DMN), where negative rumination originates. The mantra here is to **"Shut off its oxygen by denying it your attention"** and **"Do something else that engages your mind"**. This helps to overcome excessive negative rumination and harness the DMN's creative potential.
- **"Know thyself!"** – Understanding your unique "attention patterns" and strengths helps in tailoring strategies to how your brain works best.
- **"Pause often. Choose intentionally."** – This supports mindfulness and allows for deliberate decision-making rather than reactive responses.
- **"Turn up the volume on your inner cheerleader."** – This encourages positive self-talk and reminds you not to believe every negative thought.
- **"You don't always have to be in the mood to do something."** – This acknowledges that action can precede motivation, which is a helpful insight for those struggling with inertia.

---

## Level 2: Fuel Up
**Core Concept:** Regulate

*(Note: Previously called "Ration" - you may still see that term referenced in the codebase)*

<aside>
<img src="notion://custom_emoji/468360a7-dcaa-42b6-9465-64c6dcffc9e6/20ddb2d7-0969-80e2-8b8e-007a3f32101f" alt="notion://custom_emoji/468360a7-dcaa-42b6-9465-64c6dcffc9e6/20ddb2d7-0969-80e2-8b8e-007a3f32101f" width="40px" />

### Quick Overview

- **What?** A quick scan: food, water, meds, tension, overstimulation
- **How?** By checking what your body and brain need to function
- **When?** Before tasks, after emotional moments, or anytime you feel "off"
- **Why?** Regulation unlocks focus, motivation, and clarity
- **Where?** Anywhere you are, your body is the tool
</aside>

### What Is Fuel Up?

> "What does my brain and body need before I ask them to perform?"

Fuel Up is the **pause** before the push. ADHD often shows up as dysregulation, not laziness. This level helps you check your fuel tank and tend to your nervous system before jumping into tasks. You don't need to push harder — you might just need to pause smarter.

---

### Why It Matters

- ADHD brains struggle with regulation and awareness of internal needs (like hunger, thirst, or tension).
- Dysregulation = shutdown, avoidance, or spirals.
- You can't access motivation or focus when your nervous system is in distress.
- Caring for your body helps unlock the mental energy you've been waiting for.

---

### Why ADHD Brains Need This

ADHD brains often struggle with **interoception**, which means it's easy to miss basic needs, like hunger, thirst, tension, or fatigue, until they hit hard.

Here's what's happening under the surface:

- You're not avoiding the task, you're **running on empty**
- The brain needs **regulation** before it can access focus, motivation, or logic
- We often try to "push through" discomfort without noticing it's a **fuel issue**, not a willpower issue

ADHD also means we often **disconnect from our body's signals,** especially if we're in fight, flight, freeze, or fawn. Fuel Up brings you back into your body and helps you meet your needs **before** trying to force productivity.

You don't need to earn regulation. You need it to begin.

---

### When to Use This Level

- Before you start work, errands, or transitions
- When you feel off and don't know why
- When you're stuck, shut down, or avoiding tasks
- When you're overstimulated, drained, or scattered
- After something emotional, stressful, or chaotic

---

### Quick Regulation Check-In

Ask yourself:

- Have I eaten recently?
- Have I had any water?
- Are my meds active or kicking in soon?
- Is my body tense, sore, or jittery?
- Would a stretch, walk, or shake help right now?
- What's the sensory vibe — too loud, too quiet, too bright?
- Do I need music, silence, a comfort show, or some nature?

---

### Brain Dumping as Regulation

Sometimes the thing dysregulating you is *internal noise*. That's where brain dumping helps.

**A brain dump is a fast, unfiltered list of everything on your mind:** to-dos, worries, reminders, ideas, rants. You're not organizing yet. You're offloading pressure.

Why it works:

- Clears mental clutter
- Reduces overwhelm
- Helps name the things causing shutdown
- Creates space to move forward

You can do it on paper, Notion, or voice memo — whatever's easiest.

<aside>
<img src="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" alt="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" width="40px" />

### Try this:

**"What's swirling in my brain right now?"**

Brain dump for 2 minutes. No judgment. No fixing.

</aside>

---

### Regulation Toolkit Ideas

Create your own list of mini resets. Here are a few to try:

- Warm drink or cold water
- Lie down and breathe slowly for 60 seconds
- Step outside or open a window
- Listen to a grounding song
- Pet an animal or hug a pillow
- Stretch, shake, or walk around the room
- Put on cozy clothes or remove an annoying layer
- Rewatch a favorite scene or calming video

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- You can't follow the **Compass** if your nervous system is in panic mode.
- **Sails/Oars** requires accurate energy checks, which start here.
- **Anchor** works better when your body isn't screaming.
- Fuel Up gives you the capacity to handle **Storms**, **Drift**, and make steady progress.

---

## Level 3: North Star
**Core Concept:** Core Values

### What is the North Star?

> "Why do I care about this goal at all — and who am I doing it for?"

This level helps you reconnect with your *internal* motivation. Goals like "go to med school" or "lose weight" fall apart if they're driven by guilt, pressure, or someone else's expectations.

When task initiation is hard, your North Star reminds you why it's worth it.

---

### Why It Matters in ADHD Brains

- We often start things out of pressure or obligation, but **can't sustain them without emotional buy-in**
- If the goal doesn't feel meaningful, ADHD brains resist — not out of laziness, but because it lacks dopamine and relevance
- Naming your values helps you **override rejection sensitivity and task paralysis** with something real and personal
- This is about building long-term resilience, not just short-term pressure

---

### How to Use This Level

Ask:

- Why do *I* want this — not my parents, teachers, or Instagram feed?
- What part of this goal connects to who I want to be?
- What kind of life am I trying to build?

Examples:

- "I want to be a doctor because I believe everyone deserves a provider who listens."
- "I value freedom, which is why building a business matters more than playing it safe."
- "I want to feel strong because strength makes me feel like myself."
- "I care about learning — not perfection, just growing."

---

### When to Use It

- When you're questioning your goal or motivation
- When Drift or avoidance shows up
- Before recommitting to a new weekly Compass
- When external pressure is louder than your internal voice

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- Values fuel your **Lighthouse** — they give it meaning
- They give emotional depth to your **Destination**
- Your **Anchor** can be based directly on a value ("Am I acting in integrity?")
- Helps your **First Mate** remind you *why* you're doing this when you forget

---

## Level 4: Destination
**Core Concept:** Main goal

### What Is the Destination?

> "What's the bold, meaningful goal I want to move toward right now?"

Your Destination is the thing you **deeply** care about, even if it feels far away or unrealistic right now. It's the direction your work is pointing toward. Naming it helps you choose what to say *yes* and *no* to during the week.

You'll revisit and reshape it often. This level isn't about being perfect. It's about being honest.

---

### Why It Matters

- ADHD brains often struggle with goal consistency — we bounce between ideas or avoid setting goals at all.
- Having a clear Destination adds structure, purpose, and emotional fuel.
- It helps anchor your week when things feel scattered or pointless.
- It shifts focus from tiny tasks to the *big picture you care about.*

---

### When to Use This Level

- At the start of a new month, project, or goal cycle
- When you're craving clarity or motivation
- After a reset or big transition
- Any time you need to re-anchor yourself to what really matters

---

### How to Write Your Destination

Use this simple prompt, in the third person like a cheerleader or narrator:

> "[Your Name] wants to..."

**Examples:**

- "Jordan wants to finish their novel and share it with the world."
- "Alex wants to feel strong, confident, and energized in their body."
- "Taylor wants to grow their business and support themselves full time."
- "Riya wants to take the MCAT and apply to med school to save lives."

Don't worry about metrics yet. Just name the vision. The *why*. The thing that lights you up. ⭐️

---

### Pro Tip: Pick One

If you're multi-passionate or juggling a lot (which most ADHD-ers are), this can feel hard. Just pick *one* direction for now. You're not locking yourself into it forever. This is about *focus*, not limitation.

If multiple goals matter, pick the one that feels most alive *right now*.

We can always fit the other goals in later, as your routines get stronger, we'll create space for the rest.

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- Your **Anchor** keeps you connected to this goal throughout the week.
- Your **Compass** helps you break this down into practical steps.
- Your **Lighthouse** will zoom this out into your long-term dream.
- Your **First Mate** can help remind you what you're working toward when things feel chaotic.

---

## Level 5: Lighthouse
**Core Concept:** Long-term vision

### What Is the Lighthouse?

> "Where do I want to be in 6 months, 1 year, or 5 years?"

Your Lighthouse is the bigger dream you're working toward. It's the glow on the horizon — the why behind your Destination. It helps you stay grounded when the work gets hard or you lose motivation in the middle.

This isn't about perfect planning. It's about having a direction that *matters to you.*

---

### Why It Matters

- ADHD can make time feel flat, now vs. not now. A Lighthouse gives shape to the future.
- When the week feels messy, this reminds you why it's still worth showing up.
- It helps you zoom out and reconnect with purpose, not just productivity.
- Having a dream to return to builds resilience when you hit roadblocks.

---

### When to Use This Level

- When you're setting a new goal or entering a new chapter
- When motivation feels low and you need a reason to keep going
- During big life decisions or career shifts
- At quarterly reviews or end-of-month reflections

---

### How to Write Your Lighthouse

Imagine a future version of you — not perfect, just grounded and proud. What does their life feel like?

Use **present tense** (even if it hasn't happened yet).

Here are some examples with their time horizons:

- **I feel confident in my fitness and health routines.**
    - **6 Months:**

        → I consistently move my body 3–4 times per week and cook meals that fuel me.

        → I feel proud of sticking with it even when motivation dips.

    - **1 Year:**

        → I've built a sustainable fitness rhythm that fits my lifestyle.

        → I feel stronger, have more energy, and take better care of myself without guilt.

    - **5 Years:**

        → Fitness and nourishment are fully integrated into my life.

        → I trust myself to listen to my body and adjust with compassion and confidence.

        → I've created a lifestyle that feels both free and grounded — and I'm making an impact.

- **I'm living in a peaceful, organized home that makes me feel safe.**
    - **6 Months:**

        → I've decluttered key spaces and created 1–2 calming routines at home.

        → I feel more in control of my space.

    - **1 Year:**

        → My home feels functional and nurturing.

        → I've made it reflect *me*, and I can relax without guilt or shame.

    - **5 Years:**

        → I live in a space I love — maybe one I chose intentionally.

        → My home is my sanctuary, not my stressor.


- **I've graduated and feel proud of how far I've come.**
    - **6 Months:**

        → I've mapped out my remaining credits and have a plan I believe in.

        → I'm following through on deadlines, one week at a time.

    - **1 Year:**

        → I'm preparing for graduation, feeling capable and focused.

        → I trust myself to handle what's next.

    - **5 Years:**

        → I'm a doctor in residency, learning in real hospitals and caring for real patients.

        → I've become the version of myself I used to dream about — and I'm still growing.


---

### Pro Tip: Let It Be Messy

You're allowed to change your mind. Your Lighthouse can evolve.

Write the version that feels real *today* — we'll adjust course as you grow.

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- Your **Destination** is the short-term mission; your **Lighthouse** is the long-term dream.
- The **Compass** points you toward it week by week.
- When the sea gets rough (see: **Storms**), your Lighthouse keeps you oriented.
- Sharing your Lighthouse with your **First Mate** can help you stay accountable and encouraged.

---

## Level 6: Anchor
**Core Concept:** Weekly focus question

### What Is the Anchor?

> "What simple question will help me come back to myself this week?"

Your Anchor is a **short**, **powerful** thought you hold onto, especially when everything feels messy, loud, or overwhelming. It's not a to-do or a goal. It's a reminder. A filter. A grounding truth that helps you *stay steady* when the week tries to knock you off course.

---

### Why It Matters

- ADHD brains get pulled in 1,000 directions. One setback or mood shift can throw the whole day off.
- Anchors help you pause and reroute, instead of spiraling or quitting
- They give your brain **a consistent filter**, even when the world feels chaotic or your motivation disappears
- When executive function is low, we need **externalized thinking tools** — an Anchor acts like a mental compass you can return to without overthinking

Without an Anchor, it's easy to chase urgency, fall into shame loops, or forget what actually matters. Anchors create a thread you can hold onto — not to fix the chaos, but to move through it more intentionally.

---

### When to Use This Level

- When you're stuck, overwhelmed, or can't decide what to do next
- When you're spiraling into "I'm behind" or "I messed up again"
- At the start of your workday, before you pick a task
- Any time you need to regulate, reset, or reroute

---

### How to Write an Anchor

Ask yourself:

- What matters **most** to me this week?
- What question helps me make better choices right now?
- What reminder helps me feel grounded instead of frantic?

**Examples:**

- "Is this helping me build the life I want?"
- "Am I moving closer to my goals?"
- "Will this help me feel healthier tomorrow?"
- "Is this getting me closer to finishing my degree?"
- "Am I giving myself space to be human?"

---

### How to Use It

- Put it on a sticky note or phone lock screen
- Say it out loud when you're spiraling
- Use it before you pick a task or open an app
- Add it to your journal or planner
- Let it guide your yes/no decisions

This isn't about doing more. It's about doing what *matters* — on your terms.

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- Your **Destination** tells you where you're going, the **Anchor** keeps you from drifting.
- Your **Compass** breaks things into steps, but your Anchor helps you *choose* the right next step.
- When you're stuck in a **Storm** or pulled by **Drift**, the Anchor brings you back to center.
- Anchors pair well with **Buoy** check-ins, they work best when you actually see and use them.

---

## Level 7: Compass
**Core Concept:** Weekly actions

### What Is the Compass?

> "What 1 to 3 things actually matter this week?"

The Compass turns your big-picture vision into clear weekly actions. It's how you steer toward your Destination without getting lost in busywork. These are not giant, scary goals. They are small, doable moves that keep your progress meaningful.

---

### Why It Matters

- ADHD brains often see everything as equally urgent or overwhelming.
- Picking just a few priorities helps reduce task paralysis.
- This creates a sense of direction, not just movement.
- It helps you feel progress even on messy weeks.

---

### When to Use This Level

- At the start of the week or after a reset
- When your to-do list feels out of control
- When you want to feel forward motion, not just task-chasing
- During your Buoy check-in or end-of-day review

---

### How to Set Your Compass

- Pick 1 to 3 **intentional**, **achievable** priorities.
- Then break each one into a **clear, time-bound action** that fits your real life, not your ideal fantasy version.

<aside>
<img src="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" alt="/icons/pencil_gray.svg" width="40px" />

**Ask yourself:**

- What will move me closer to my **Destination** or **Lighthouse**?
- What do I want to feel proud of this week?
- If I only do three things, what would actually matter?
</aside>

<aside>
<img src="/icons/calendar-day_gray.svg" alt="/icons/calendar-day_gray.svg" width="40px" />

**Set a Date & Be Specific**

Instead of "study flashcards," try:

> "Study flashcards for 20 minutes on Mon, Wed, and Fri at 8 a.m. before work."

Instead of "declutter," try:

> "Set a timer and declutter one drawer Saturday morning after breakfast."

The more specific, the more real. Be kind, but don't leave it vague. This is how we actually follow through.

</aside>

<aside>
<img src="/icons/clock_gray.svg" alt="/icons/clock_gray.svg" width="40px" />

**And however long you *think* it's going to take, double or triple it.**

- Time blindness is real. Building in buffer time protects your energy and reduces shame when things take longer than expected.
- The more specific, the more real. Be kind, but don't leave it vague. This is how we actually follow through.
</aside>

**Examples**:

- 🏋🏻‍♀️ **Fitness & Health**
    1. Do a 20-minute strength workout on Mon, Wed, Fri at 6:30 p.m. right after work
    2. Meal prep 5 protein-rich breakfasts (eggs + veggies) on Sunday at 10 a.m.
    3. Set a 10 p.m. phone alarm every night this week and plug phone in across the room
- 💼 **Business Building**
    1. Draft 1 Instagram post on Tuesday 11 a.m. at the café after my walk
    2. DM 2 people about my offer Thursday morning after my first cup of coffee
    3. Edit pricing section of my website Friday at 3 p.m. before emails
- 🏠 **Home Organization**
    1. Declutter bathroom drawer Saturday morning after breakfast (set a 15-minute timer)
    2. Do 5-minute nightly reset after brushing teeth each night
    3. Light a candle and play jazz while eating dinner on Tuesday and Friday
- **🎓 Graduation Progress**
    1. Finish psych reading Tuesday 8–9:30 p.m. at the library
    2. Write draft outline Thursday at 2 p.m. in the study room
    3. Email professor for feedback Friday before 12 p.m.
- 🩺 **MCAT Prep**
    1. Review flashcards for 20 minutes on Mon, Wed, Fri at 8 a.m. before work
    2. Take one full-length Chem/Phys section Saturday 10 a.m. at the library
    3. Schedule 30-minute walk after every study session (pre-plan times on Sunday)

---

### Pro Tip: Start With One

If you're feeling low-energy or overwhelmed, start with just one.

Circle it. That's your North Star for the week. Anything else is bonus.

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- Your **Destination** tells you what you want. The **Compass** helps you act on it.
- Your **Anchor** can help you choose which priority matters most.
- Your **Sails/Oars** tell you when to tackle each task based on energy.
- The **Logbook** reflects how it went, not how perfect it was.

---

## Level 8: Sails/Oars
**Core Concept:** Energy check

### What Is This Level?

> "When do I feel my best — and what helps me move forward when I don't?"

**⛵️ Sails** are your high-energy windows — times when your brain and body are aligned, and you can move forward with ease and momentum.

**🚣 Oars** are your steady-energy strategies — tools you use to keep moving when things feel heavy, foggy, or low-motivation.

Both help you **move forward**. Sails catch the wind. Oars keep you from drifting when the wind dies.

This level helps you stop shaming yourself for inconsistent energy and start designing your week around how your brain and body actually work.

---

### Why It Matters

- ADHD energy is inconsistent — not because you're lazy, but because your brain burns through fuel differently.
- You're not meant to be "on" all day. Knowing your best energy windows helps you work smarter.
- Oars help prevent shame spirals when the wind dies down. They remind you: you can still move, even slowly.

---

### When to Use This Level

- When setting your Compass priorities
- When planning your weekly or daily schedule
- When a task feels impossible and you're not sure why
- When you're beating yourself up for "wasting time" or "not being productive enough"

---

### How to Identify Your Sails

Your Sails are your best energy windows, times when focus feels easier and forward motion takes less effort. Let's figure out when that actually happens for you.

**Ask yourself:**

> When do I usually feel clear, motivated, or creative?

> What times of day feel easiest for focus, planning, or moving?

> What environmental factors help me ride the wind? (music, sunlight, location, etc.)

**Examples**:

- "I focus best between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. after coffee"
- "I get a second wind around 8 p.m. after dinner"
- "I can write well after a walk or workout"
- "I feel most motivated when I leave the house"

---

### How to Define Your Oars

Oars are your steady-energy tools. They help you keep moving forward when you don't have a full tank.

**Ask yourself**:

> What helps me take action when I feel low-energy or stuck?

> What gentle strategies keep me going when I can't rely on motivation?

> What tools keep me from spiraling when I feel behind?

**Examples:**

- "Using a 10-minute timer to just start"
- "Switching to a cozier location (couch, coffee shop)"
- "Doing the task in a lo-fi, imperfect way"
- "Putting on a playlist or comfort show as background"
- "Body doubling with a friend or accountability partner"

---

### Map Your Weekly Energy Patterns

We can use this table to sketch out your energy highs and lows across a typical day. This helps you spot your natural **Sails,** and plan **Oars** where you need support.

You can **change the time blocks** to match your actual routine — this is just a flexible starting point.

| Time Block | Energy Level (High, Medium, Low) | Notes (Triggers, patterns, etc.) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 6–9 a.m. |  |  |
| 9–12 p.m. |  |  |
| 12–3 p.m. |  |  |
| 3–6 p.m. |  |  |
| 6–9 p.m. |  |  |
| 9–12 a.m. |  |  |

---

### Plan With Real Capacity

- Don't cram your day with high-energy tasks back to back
- Leave buffer space between Sails to recover
- Use Oars to warm up, cool down, or reset mid-task
- Match your **Compass priorities** to your **energy window**, not your shame spiral

Match focus-heavy tasks with your **Sails**. For everything else, lean on **Oars** to keep steady progress without burning out.

### Bonus Prompts

- What drains my energy the fastest?
- What gives me a boost when I need one?
- How can I give myself grace on low-capacity days without giving up?

✍️ Major Drains to Avoid or Plan Around:

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- **Compass** gives you the what, **Sails/Oars** help you decide when and how.
- If you're dysregulated, go back to **Fuel Up** first.
- If your plans are falling apart, your **Anchor** and energy map will help reroute.
- When facing **Storms** or **Drift**, your Oars can save the day without burning you out.

---

## Level 9: Storms
**Core Concept:** Big challenges

### What Are Storms?

> "What's likely to knock me off course this week?"

Storms are the big internal or external forces that could throw you off — illness, burnout, grief, deadlines, fear, rejection, or something unexpected. This level is about **naming the obstacles** before they sneak up on you. When you expect resistance, you can meet it with strategy, not shame.

---

### Why It Matters

- ADHD brains often **underestimate** challenges or feel blindsided when things go wrong
- Naming your Storms lets you prepare for them, instead of pretending they won't happen
- Acknowledging difficulty builds resilience and reduces shame when plans change
- Sometimes the Storm is internal and naming it gives it less power

---

### Why Storms Happen in ADHD Brains

ADHD brains often live in **now vs. not now**, which makes it hard to prepare for hard things that *haven't happened yet*. We may feel fine until the moment the storm hits — then everything feels urgent and overwhelming at once.

Here's what's happening:

- We often have **time blindness**, so we underestimate how long hard things will take
- We struggle with **emotional regulation**, so small disruptions can spiral into shutdowns
- We tend to rely on **last-minute adrenaline**, which works until it suddenly doesn't
- When things fall apart, our first thought is often "What's wrong with me?" instead of "What support do I need?"

Storms are not personal failures. They're conditions. And when we name them early, we create space for **realistic flexibility instead of reactive shame**.

---

### When to Use This Level

- At the beginning of your week or during Sunday planning
- When something big is coming up (emotionally or logistically)
- If you've been spiraling and don't know why
- Anytime you're feeling stuck, scattered, or out of control

---

### Examples of Storms

**Internal Storms (mindset, emotions, beliefs):**

- Fear of rejection or failure
- Perfectionism
- Emotional hangover from a hard convo
- Anxiety about disappointing others
- Shame about being behind

**External Storms (schedule, environment, events):**

- A busy workweek or back-to-back meetings
- Travel or houseguests
- A big test, interview, or presentation
- Illness, poor sleep, or chronic pain
- Family drama or relationship tension

---

### How to Navigate the Storm

Ask:

> What can I realistically do to prepare for or soften this?

> What support or flexibility might I need to ride it out?

> What will I *not* blame myself for if it slows me down?

### **Storm Navigation Example: Deadlines Approaching**

**Storm:** "I have a huge report due Wednesday and I'm already behind."

**Plan:**

- Cancel your Tuesday night social plans
- Block off 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. on Tuesday and Wednesday for deep work (phone on Do Not Disturb)
- Prep snacks and water ahead of time so you don't use hunger as an excuse to quit
- Let your accountability buddy know you'll check in at 12:05 p.m. each day
</aside>

<aside>
<img src="/icons/cloud_gray.svg" alt="/icons/cloud_gray.svg" width="40px" />

### **Storm Navigation Example: Fear of Starting**

**Storm:** "I'm scared to start this task because I think I'll mess it up."

**Plan:**

- Set a timer for just 10 minutes to do the first messy draft — no pressure to finish
- Remind yourself: "Done is better than perfect" — write that on a sticky note
- Move to a different location to break the avoidance loop (e.g., coffee shop or new playlist)
- Tell yourself: "If I still hate it after 10 minutes, I can stop — but I just have to *start*"
</aside>

<aside>
<img src="/icons/cloud_gray.svg" alt="/icons/cloud_gray.svg" width="40px" />

### **Storm Navigation Example: Poor Sleep Dread**

**Storm:** "I didn't sleep well and I know my brain will be slower today."

**Plan:**

- Push harder tasks to tomorrow or swap them for admin/easy tasks today
- Use Oars: work in 15-minute chunks with soft music and a cozy setup
- Take a power nap or do a light walk before trying anything focus-heavy
- Adjust your Compass, don't try to do five things at 30% energy
</aside>

---

### Pro Tip

**Storms are not personal failures.** They're just part of the weather.

If you treat them like conditions to work with, not flaws to fix, you stay in motion.

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- Your **Anchor** helps you stay steady during the storm
- Your **Fuel Up** and **Oars** help you regulate and adjust
- Your **Compass** might need to shrink or shift — that's okay
- When a Storm hits, **Drift** is more likely — so get ahead of it

---

## Level 10: Sirens/Drift
**Core Concept:** Sneaky distractions

### What Is Drift?

> "What sneaky habits, distractions, or avoidance patterns tend to pull me off track?"

Unlike Storms, Drift is **quiet**. It's the low-key stuff that slips in when you're tired, bored, anxious, or avoiding discomfort. Drift doesn't feel dangerous, it feels comforting or urgent, which makes it harder to catch.

This level is about spotting those subtle pulls **before** they steer you too far off course.

---

### Why It Matters

- Drift is sneaky. You look up and realize you lost hours or abandoned your priorities
- ADHD brains crave novelty, stimulation, and instant relief — Drift exploits that
- Catching Drift is how you build **gentle self-awareness without shame**
- Naming it gives you more choices, not more rules

---

### Why Drift Happens in ADHD Brains

ADHD brains aren't broken — they're wired for **novelty, stimulation, and immediate reward**. Drift happens when your brain is trying to:

- Escape something boring, hard, or emotionally uncomfortable
- Chase quick dopamine (scrolling, shopping, starting something new)
- Regulate itself when you're tired, hungry, overstimulated, or under-stimulated

ADHD also impacts:

- **Inhibition** (harder to stop yourself mid-scroll)
- **Task switching** (easy to start something new without noticing)
- **Interoception** (missing signs that you need a break, not a browser tab)

So your brain drifts not because you're lazy or distracted — but because it's trying to help you feel better *fast*. The key is noticing the drift and gently rerouting, not blaming yourself for how your brain works.

---

### When to Use This Level

- When you "accidentally" lose 2 hours
- When you feel stuck, distracted, or avoidant
- When you're scrolling, cleaning, or overworking instead of doing the thing
- When Storms hit and you default to old coping habits

---

### Examples of Drift and Sirens

**Common Drift/Sirens Triggers:**

- Avoiding discomfort or perfectionism
- Emotional overwhelm
- Fear of failure or being judged
- Under-stimulation (task feels boring or too easy)
- Over-stimulation (task feels chaotic or too hard)

**Common Drift/Sirens Behaviors:**

- Scrolling TikTok, Reddit, YouTube "just for a sec"
- Mindless online shopping to avoid discomfort or chase dopamine
- Suddenly deep-cleaning your kitchen to avoid work
- Starting 5 new tasks instead of finishing one
- Obsessive tweaking (re-editing, reformatting, over-planning)
- Jumping from tab to tab instead of closing one thing

---

### How to Interrupt Drift

Ask:

- What was I *supposed* to be doing right now?
- What am I avoiding?
- What would a kind interruption look like?

**Anti-Drift Tools (Sirens):**

- A sticky note on your laptop with your Anchor question
- A kitchen timer set for 15 minutes
- App blockers (like Forest, Freedom, or Cold Turkey)
- Music or ambience to re-ground you
- One accountability text: "Hey, I'm about to start [task], check on me in 20?"

---

### Pro Tip: Some Drift Is Just a Signal

Not all Drift is sabotage. Sometimes it's telling you something:

- You need food, rest, or a brain dump
- You're stuck in perfectionism
- You don't care about the task and need to change direction
- You're afraid, and it's time to use an Oar, not force

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- Drift shows up when a **Storm** isn't named — or when energy is low and **Oars** aren't in place
- Your **Anchor** can gently pull you back
- Your **Fuel Up** may need to be revisited before you can refocus
- Your **First Mate** can help you name the pattern and interrupt it with kindness

---

## Level 11: Lifeboat
**Core Concept:** Clarity tools

### What Is the Lifeboat?

Lifeboat is your **executive function support system**. When your brain feels like it has 1000 tabs open, Lifeboat helps you pause, reset, and sort through the mess — without spiraling.

This space holds your clarity tools:

- Your **organization system** (PARA Method)
- Your **thinking tools** (templates, AI helpers, prompts)
- Your **reset rituals** (routines, checklists, or workflows that keep you moving)

---

### Why This Helps ADHD Brains

ADHD brains thrive with **structure, visual clarity, and external storage**. But we often get overwhelmed by too many notes, tasks, tools, or tabs, and then *shut down.* The Lifeboat gives you a place to pause, sort, and get your mind (and digital world) back to baseline.

It works because:

- It **offloads working memory** (your brain doesn't have to hold everything)
- It reduces **decision fatigue** by showing you what's active and what's just noise
- It helps you distinguish between "urgent" and "important"
- It creates a **low-pressure starting point** when you don't know what to do next
- It supports flexible routines, so you can re-enter at any time, not just "start over"

This isn't about becoming perfectly organized, it's about building a system that helps you stay afloat when your brain feels full.

---

### When to Use Lifeboat

- When your to-do list feels endless and you don't know where to start
- When your digital tools (Notion, Google Drive, etc.) feel messy or disorganized
- When you're task-switching constantly but not finishing anything
- After a crash, missed deadline, or week of avoidance — instead of "starting over," use this to *rebuild gently*
- When you're procrastinating because your ideas feel too big or disorganized
- When you've collected a bunch of stuff (notes, links, tabs) but don't know what to do with it

---

### The PARA Method

This is a simple way to sort your ideas, tasks, and files into four categories:

| **Section** | **What Goes Here** |
| --- | --- |
| **Projects** | Anything with a clear deadline or outcome (ex: "Finish personal statement," "Apply to 3 jobs") |
| **Areas** | Ongoing responsibilities you maintain over time (ex: Health, Money, School) |
| **Resources** | Notes, links, saved ideas, or helpful info you want to keep |
| **Archive** | Old things you're done with, but not ready to delete |

<aside>

**🛠 Use this to organize:**

- Google Drive folders
- Notion pages
- Notes apps
- Computer Files
- Your brain dumps
</aside>

---

### Templates & Tools You Can Use

- 📝 **Quick Sort Template**

    → Brain feels messy? Drop everything into a "Dump" column. Then drag into Project / Area / Resource.

- 📎 **Mini Weekly Organizer**

    → 3 projects → 3 main tasks → match to energy windows

    (*Great for ADHD-friendly planning*)

- **🧠 Idea Vault**

    → A place to store ideas you don't want to lose — but don't need to act on yet.

---

### AI Helpers (Optional)

If you like using tools like ChatGPT or Notion AI, here are ways they can help:

- Summarize messy notes or meeting transcripts
- Generate a rough draft for stuck writing
- Create a checklist from a brain dump
- Help you name or organize folders, pages, or categories

---

### Reset Rituals

When Lifeboat needs a reboot:

- Do a 10-minute brain dump
- Use your Quick Sort Template
- Clean your desktop or clear 5 tabs
- Walk + voice note what's stuck
- Schedule a Lifeboat session for 30 minutes, no pressure, just clarity

---

### Lifeboat Reminder

Lifeboat isn't a system for perfection, it's a system for **progress with less stress**.

Use it:

- When you feel overwhelmed
- When your tools get messy
- When you don't know what to do next
- When you feel like quitting but still want clarity

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- Supports your **Compass** by helping you see what actions actually matter this week
- Reduces **Drift** by giving you a clear place to reset when distractions take over
- Makes it easier to review your **Logbook** and track progress when your materials are organized
- Helps keep your **Anchor** and **Destination** visible by cutting through the noise
- Can be used alongside **Fuel Up** when your brain is overloaded and you need to pause and sort

---

## Level 12: Buoy
**Core Concept:** Check-in cue

### What Is a Buoy?

> "When will I pause and check in with myself?"

The Buoy is your chosen moment to pause, reflect, and adjust. It helps you track how the week is actually going, before it fully derails. This isn't about journaling every day or logging data. It's about building a lightweight habit that helps you **notice**.

Think of it as a floating checkpoint: not heavy, not perfect, just something that helps you **rise up and reset.**

---

### Why It Matters

- ADHD brains easily lose track of time and progress.
- We often **don't realize how far off track we are** until something breaks (a deadline, our body, a relationship)
- Buoys bring in gentle **pattern recognition**, which is the first step to real self-trust
- Regular check-ins give us a chance to **adjust instead of abandon,** something ADHD brains deeply benefit from

If you don't look up for air, you won't know which way you're drifting.

---

### When to Use This Level

- Once a week, on a consistent day or routine
- When the week feels foggy or chaotic
- Right before planning your next Compass
- After you've navigated a Storm or noticed Drift

---

### Examples of Buoy Moments

- Every weekday night before bed at 9:30pm
- Sunday evening while setting up the week
- Friday afternoon before the weekend
- After your last Zoom meeting on Thursdays
- During a walk or over coffee on Saturday
- During a regular routine like brushing your teeth or meal prepping

---

### What You Might Reflect On

- How did I do with my Compass goals?
- What felt hard or heavy today or this week?
- What surprised me?
- What did I actually do well? (Small wins count)
- What do I want to adjust next week?

This doesn't need to be written down — but it helps if you're building awareness. Think of it as emotional GPS.

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- Helps you track how your **Compass** and **Sails/Oars** are actually working
- Makes it easier to catch **Drift** before it turns into disconnection
- Let's you notice the impact of **Storms** without judgment
- Builds a feedback loop that strengthens your **Anchor** and **Destination**

---

## Level 13: First Mate
**Core Concept:** Support system

### What Is the First Mate?

> "Who's helping me stay steady on this journey?"

Your First Mate is someone you trust to walk alongside you. It might be your coach (hi), a friend, partner, or peer. This isn't about someone micromanaging you, it's about having a witness, encourager, or gentle anchor who helps you stay connected to your goals.

If the sailing gets rocky, they remind you: you're not doing this alone.

---

### Why This Matters in ADHD Brains

- ADHD brains often carry a **deep fear of letting others down**, which leads to hiding or withdrawing
- We may also struggle with **object permanence for people** → out of sight, out of mind
- Without regular check-ins, we can go weeks without realizing how isolated or overwhelmed we feel
- External support gives structure, perspective, and **emotional regulation** when our inner world feels scrambled

Having a First Mate doesn't make you needy, it makes you human. ADHD thrives in connection, not isolation.

---

### When to Use This Level

- When setting a new goal or starting a big task
- During Storms, Drift, or burnout
- When you're trying to build new habits or routines
- When you need accountability that feels kind, not controlling

---

### First Mate Options

Your First Mate might be:

- A coach, therapist, or mentor
- A partner who checks in weekly
- A friend who works alongside you or co-plans
- A peer in a similar season or goal
- A study buddy, gym partner, or co-working group
- Even a well-designed app or automation that nudges you to stay present

**You can also name a Second Mate or your Support Crew** — someone who isn't deeply involved, but still cheers you on or supports you emotionally.

---

### What Support Might Look Like

- A weekly check-in text: "How'd that thing go?"
- Body doubling: working alongside someone (in person or virtually) to stay focused
- A shared tracker, calendar, or to-do list
- Planning together every Sunday night
- Gentle nudges: "Take a break," "Try again," "You got this"
- Celebrating progress (even when you feel behind)

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- Your First Mate helps you reconnect with your **Anchor** when you're lost
- They can help you stay aligned with your **Compass**, especially on tough weeks
- When Drift or Storms show up, they're a steady hand on the wheel
- They remind you of your **Lighthouse**, even when you forget why you started

---

### Also: Science-Backed Resilience from Connection

Steve Magness highlights in *Do Hard Things* and *Win the Inside Game* that **social connection isn't just comforting** → **it's physiologically healing**:

- After a failure or big disappointment, being around safe people boosts **oxytocin**, helping reduce stress and rebuild confidence quickly
- Supportive presence shifts our brain from **threat mode** to **challenge mode**, making it easier to recover and re-engage
- In ADHD coaching, this ritual of reconnecting *after* setbacks helps integrate the failure and keeps shame from stripping away momentum

---

## Level 14: Logbook
**Core Concept:** Reflection style

### What Is a Logbook?

> "How do I want to track what's actually happening in my brain, body, or life?"

The Logbook is your personal record. Not for perfection, not for judgment. It's just a place to reflect on your progress, patterns, and needs. Whether that's one sentence, one emoji, or a short brain dump, this level is about *noticing*.

You don't have to do it every day. You just have to do it *your way.*

---

### Why This Matters in ADHD Brains

- ADHD makes it hard to notice progress. We forget what we've done and focus on what we haven't
- We can fall into **all-or-nothing** thinking: "I didn't do everything, so it doesn't count"
- Self-trust grows through **evidence and awareness**, not harsh tracking
- Reflection builds **pattern recognition.** It helps us plan better, recover faster, and celebrate more

If you don't reflect, your brain will default to "I didn't do enough." The Logbook helps you prove otherwise.

---

### When to Use This Level

- Once a week during your Buoy check-in
- After you complete a hard task or experience a setback
- At the end of each day (if helpful — not required)
- When you feel scattered and want to see what's real

---

### Logbook Formats

Pick one that matches your energy and brain style. Switch them up as needed:

- **Fast Bullet Log**

    → What I did, what I avoided, how I feel

- **Evidence Journal**

    → Write down *any* past or present proof that shows you can do hard things (even if it was when you were 13)

    → For each entry, use this format:

    **What I did:**

    - "I planned a whole group trip in college."
    - "I passed a class I thought I'd fail."
    - "I showed up to work every day even when I was anxious."

    **How I did it:**

    - "I broke it into pieces and kept asking for updates."
    - "I got tutoring, used YouTube videos, and didn't give up after a bad grade."
    - "I made a playlist that calmed me down and set a reward for every shift."
- **Emoji Check-in**

    → Mood: 😐 / Energy: ⚡ / Wins: ✅

- **Audio Reflection**

    → Record a voice memo to vent, process, or note a win

- **Mini Journal Prompt**

    → "What worked today?" "What felt sticky?" "What did I learn?"

- **Progress Glance**

    → Use a tracker, habit app, or calendar and give yourself credit

- **No Log**

    → Yes, this is an option. If logging adds pressure or shame, skip it.


---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- It helps you assess how well your **Compass**, **Sails**, and **Anchor** are working
- It shows how **Storms** and **Drift** show up — and how you responded
- It feeds insight back into your next week's plan
- It gives your **First Mate** or coach real patterns to reflect on with you

---

## Level 15: Starlight
**Core Concept:** Wins & gratitude

### What Is Starlight?

> "What am I proud of this week — big or small?"

Starlight is about naming the good, *on purpose*. Whether it's a small win, a shift in mindset, or something that made you smile, this level is how we remind ourselves that progress is happening — even when it doesn't look perfect.

This is the celebration level. Not toxic positivity. Just proof that you're still in motion.

---

### Why This Matters in ADHD Brains

- ADHD brains often **only remember what went wrong** — we forget wins unless we write them down
- Celebrating progress builds **dopamine in healthy, sustainable ways**
- Gratitude helps calm the nervous system, shift perspective, and reduce shame
- Small wins activate **pattern recognition** — which is what makes habits stick

If you skip this step, your brain might tell you the week was a failure — even if you crushed half of it. Starlight is how you keep a balanced record.

---

### When to Use This Level

- During your weekly **Buoy** check-in
- At the end of a hard day, to reset your focus
- Any time you need a mood lift or perspective shift
- After navigating a Storm, Drift, or showing up when it wasn't easy

---

### What Counts as a Win?

Literally anything that required effort, intention, or regulation. Especially the stuff no one sees but you.

**Examples:**

- Got out of bed and stretched even though I didn't want to
- Sent an email I'd been avoiding for days
- Made a meal instead of skipping or ordering takeout
- Asked for help when I was overwhelmed
- Didn't beat myself up after a mistake
- Talked to myself with kindness instead of spiraling
- Paused to take a breath instead of snapping
- Said no to something that drained me
- Finished a task *without redoing it five times*

---

### Bonus: Gratitude Add-On

Gratitude can help you reconnect with your environment, body, and values.

Try writing one sentence:

- "Today I'm grateful for…"
- "One moment that brought me peace was…"
- "Something that made me feel connected was…"

---

### How It Connects to Other Levels

- It's a natural close to your **Buoy** check-in
- It reinforces your **Evidence Journal** in your **Logbook**
- It helps regulate your mood after **Storms** or **Drift**
- It keeps your eyes on the **Lighthouse**, even on foggy days

---
